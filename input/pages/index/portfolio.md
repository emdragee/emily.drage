## Portfolio

---

Welcome to my web development portfolio. Here, youâ€™ll find projects that I completed as part of earning my Certificate IV in Information Technology (Web Development) and Diploma of Information Technology (Front End Web Development).

In the future, I will also include any freelance work I take on, so check back for updates as my portfolio continues to grow.

I have also been working on an alternative view for my portfolio page wich can be found here
