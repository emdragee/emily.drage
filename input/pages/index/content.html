    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Emily Drage, a jack of all trades (and a master of someâ€¦) with a passion for both visual arts and technology. I aim to build a broad knowledge base rather than focusing on a few specific skills, as I believe this makes me a better problem solver and a stronger asset in team environments.</p>
    <p>For a long time, I saw art as a hobby, but working as an IT business support officer made me realize the creative potential in designing websites and applications. Thatâ€™s when I started applying my artistic skills to UX and UI design, where I discovered I had a natural flairâ€”particularly in user experience design.</p>
    <p>I thrive in team settings where I can bounce ideas around, solve problems collaboratively, and be creative within clear guidelines (as odd as that may sound!). I love problem-solving, and I believe the best solutions come from working together with a team of experts.</p>
