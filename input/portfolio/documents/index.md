## 📖Real Life Client 

### Public Libraries Western Australia (PLWA) 

This project was completed in collaboration with a real-life client, the Public Libraries Western Australia (PLWA) association, as part of a student team during the completion of a Diploma of Front-End Web Development. The project required my team to design and develop a custom WordPress parent theme tailored to the needs of the organization.
