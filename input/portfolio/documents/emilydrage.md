This site is powered by Cloudflare Pages, a free and reliable hosting platform for static websites. For this project, I used the minimalist static site generator Adduce. Why? Because I’d already crafted a custom template using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and most other generators seem to lean heavily on pre-built themes. Adduce’s simplicity made it the perfect match for my vision, allowing me to seamlessly integrate my existing design.

### Branding: Finding My Eye-dentity 👁️

After many different versions and attempts, I decided to go back to my roots when designing a brand logo for myself. I took inspiration from my art, I like to draw eyes 👀, and whats better than an eye for an icon. 

<div class="article-page-img-centered" >
    <img class="no-border" src="/assets/eye-icon.svg" alt="Eye icon brand emilydrage." width="100px">
</div>

While I initially added this logo to my navigation bar, I wasn’t thrilled with how it looked in light and dark modes.

Example dark mode nav with icon:
![dark nav](/assets/dark-nav.png)

Eample light mode with icon:
![light nav](/assets/light-nav.png)

That’s why I decided to simplify things by using a clean, minimal chevron symbol </> as my navigation icon. It’s sleek, functional, and blends effortlessly with the overall design!

### Light Dark Mode them switch 🌞🌙

You may have noticed the light dark mode theme switch on my website. This component was cleaverly designed by Adam Argyle. I replicated it by following the article he wrote "[Building a theme switch component](https://web.dev/articles/building/a-theme-switch-component)".

Not only does this component include a smooth animation, but it also adapts to your device’s theme preferences. Change your device’s theme, and my website will follow suit—no extra clicks required. How cool is that?
