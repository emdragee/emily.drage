## Pet Project

---

A website created around a personal interest topic. This project utilized semantic HTML, CSS Grid, and some JavaScript. Like the Market Place project, it focused on ensuring both HTML and CSS validation, reinforcing best practices in coding standards and accessibility.

### Emolyy.Art Website

This website was made purely as a tafe project and is currently no longer being hosted. I will eventually create a new art portfolio site in the furture.

### Using modern image file formats

My art website features a large collection of images showcasing my artwork. I plan to redesign the site in the future and update the images to use WebP or, ideally, JPEG XL as the format becomes more widely supported. Below is an example of one of my artworks displayed as a PNG and as a low-quality WebPâ€”can you spot the differences?

Additionally, I am utilizing Cloudflare CDN to host my images, further enhancing the website's loading speed.
